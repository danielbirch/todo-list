# todo-list

A to do list tutorial by "developedbyed" with some of my own features such as preventing blank tasks from being added and a message that lets you know when you have no more tasks left.

I want to add sanitization to the innerHTML to protect against vulnerabilities. But I'll leave this for later as this is my first JavaScript project. DOMPurify has been uploaded to this project for later use.

There is also an issue with the select field, it only actions the option you select when you click on it the second time. The functionality works, however the action is not working properly so I need to look into the cause of this also.
